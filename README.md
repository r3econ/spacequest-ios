# Spacequest for iOS (2014-2023, updated for iPhone 15)
Full source code of a working `iOS` game. Yet another take on a space shooter game. The game falls into [Shoot 'em up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up) video games genre. It is written in Swift and uses `SpriteKit`- graphics rendering and animation infrastructure built into `iOS`. All vector graphics and image assets created in `Inkscape` and `GIMP`.

# What could be improved
The app was created as a multi-weekend project long time ago. It is updated to run in the latest IDEs, but couple of things could be either added or improved. Not having time to do it is the problem.
- Adding tests
- iPad support and better support for iPhone X
- Internationalization
- Moving images and colors to asset catalogs
- Adding more abstraction for constants (now constants are spread spread among multiple source files)
- Improving enemy creation logic to make enemies spawn faster
- Adding new enemy types
- More weapons
- Scrolling background (parallax style)
